#compdef colorcoke
# vim:ft=zsh:
# zsh completion script for colorcoke. Copy this file to your zsh function path
# ( /usr/share/zsh/site_functions for example).
#
# If you do not want to install i globally, you can copy it somewhere else and
# add that directory to $fpath. This must be done before compinit is called.
# If the file is copied to ~/.zsh/compdef, your ~/.zshrc file could look like
# this:
#
# fpath=("$HOME/.zsh/compdef" $fpath)
# autoload -U compinit
# compinit
