NAME
    colorcoke - modify the extended, non-ANSI terminal colorset

DESCRIPTION
    colorcoke shows off some cool things you can do with the
    Term::ExtendedColor family of modules.

    colorcke lets one modify the extended colorset (88-16 or 256-16 colors,
    respectively) for a running terminal session. The change takes effect
    immediately - no need to restart the terminal, like when using xrdb.

    Shades and tints can be generated for an arbitary number of ranges.

    The ANSI colors can be left untouched, be included in a shade or set
    separately. One can also exclude everything but the ANSI colors. The
    ANSI colors is untouched by default.

    The grey scale ramp (extended color index 232-255) is left untouched by
    default. To include them, set the end point to 255.

    Additional colors can be left untouched by specifying their index with
    the --no flag. This can also be configured in the configuration file.

    The base color to use is specified with the -c flag, and the stepping is
    controlled with the -r, -g and -b flag - red, green and blue channel.

    Red, blue and green amount is specified with -rr, -rg and -rb when the
    randomizing option is used.
